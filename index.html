  <dt>What is a pattern library?</dt>
  <dd>Generally thought of as reusable user interface designs represented by html and css.</dd>
  <dt>What is THIS pattern library?</dt>
  <dd>A set of reusable html template files, coupled with styling by css and functionality from javascript. These html/css/js files are packaged with example data.</dd>
  <dt>What makes them reusable?</dt>
  <dd>The included html files are in one (or more) templating formats such as <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">twig</a> or <a href="https://mustache.github.io">mustache</a>, which include {{curlyBraced}} placeholders for data. These files can be styled in your favorite design-in-browser tool after compiling with the included dummy data or imported into your cms system as raw templates.</dd>
